This GitHub repository contains an example R folder and subfolders, feel free to look through. The code here has been written to demonstrate reproducible, reuseable code.
Remember, there is code inside the `functions` folder that is used in the main script, so look for the code there.

Feel free to use Quarto rather than RMarkdown if you prefer. 

### Git and GitHub

In the assignment, you will need to upload your work to GitHub. Make sure your GitHub name is anonymous. 

Instructions are available for using Github through RStudio in the [Prep Instructions](https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/273641/files/7604348?module_item_id=2848756) 
and in the [Lesson Part 02](https://github.com/LydiaFrance/Reproducible_Figures_R/blob/newMT2024/lesson_notebook02_goodfigures.ipynb)
and I have a [troubleshooting guide on Canvas](https://canvas.ox.ac.uk/courses/273641/discussion_topics/847242). 

But if it is still not working, use the following instructions instead which require no installation on your computer:
